:: Wolfenstein: The New Order Head Tracking - Install
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - install body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/install-body-asi.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: install behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper.
::
:: Source of truth for everything below the CONFIG BLOCK:
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/install-wrapper-asi.cmd. Copy this
:: file to <mod>/scripts/install.cmd, fill in the CONFIG BLOCK, change nothing
:: else. scripts/conformance.ps1 checks that nothing else changed.
::
:: Ultimate ASI Loader: one DLL renamed to the proxy the game already
:: imports, with the mod shipped as an .asi beside the game exe. Check the
:: exe's import table before choosing ASI_LOADER_NAME - a proxy the game does
:: not import is never loaded and the mod silently does nothing.

:: Subdirectory below the exe directory to deploy into, for engines that load

set "ASI_SUBDIR="
:: Files copied only when they are not already there, so an upgrade keeps
:: whatever the user tuned. Listing an .ini in MOD_DLLS instead puts it through
:: the unconditional copy and resets every key on every update.
::
:: Empty: the mod creates its own CameraUnlock.ini on first run, importing the
:: HeadTracking.ini an earlier version left, so there is no file to seed. A
:: seeded CameraUnlock.ini would stop that import.
set "MOD_SEED_FILES="
:: Version of the vendored Ultimate ASI Loader, recorded in the state file so
:: the launcher can tell which loader build it is looking at. Leave empty to
:: omit the field. Bump alongside vendor/ via `pixi run update-deps`.

:: Pin delayed expansion off before `%*` is expanded on the `call` below.
:: Under `cmd /V:ON`, or with DelayedExpansion=1 in

:: expanded line, and a real game path like C:\Games\Oh! My Game reaches the
:: body already mangled. The body pins expansion off at its own outer scope
:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
